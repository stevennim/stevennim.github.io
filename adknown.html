          Adknown Inc. is an online media company founded as a startup in 2011. Located in the heart of downtown Guelph,
          the
          company’s main specialty is advertising technology.
          They manage multiple search and web portals as well as having developed a wide array of tools to manage ad
          networks and drive traffic to specific environments.
          Adknown’s game development department, a.k.a. Adknown Games, utilizes the Unity game engine to develop mobile
          phone games for iOS and Android.
          The team works in an agile environment, dedicating short development sprints to each game they publish while
          still
          maintaining a level of quality.
          <br><br>
          There are currently over 200 games published by Adknown Games that are available on the market. I worked for
          Adknown Games from May to August 2019 as a co-op Game Developer.
          During my time at Adknown, I developed a total of 6 games (plus one additional, unreleased game I helped
          another
          developer create).

    <div class="container-md">
      <h2 class="text-md-center">Goals/Learning Outcomes</h2>
      <p class="text-md-left">
        <li>Become proficient in Unity.</li>
        <li>Develop effective debugging skills that will enhance my overall problem solving skills too.</li>
        <li>Improve interpersonal and active listening skills.</li>

          for my games going forward.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <div>
        My first two goals of improving Unity proficiency and debugging skills were directly tied to my task of
        developing
        games, but my third goal was more personal. In general, I wanted my goals to affect the development of skills I
        could utilize in a variety of jobs (hence why I went for some social skill improvement goals).
        <br><br>
        I mainly wanted to learn skills that would make me a better programmer overall (detail-orientation, debugging,
        problem solving, etc). Many of these skills also tie into just having a good work ethic. I wanted to improve
        skills that would be useful not only in future work environments, but also useful for my overall work ethic. For
        example, I often had trouble figuring out why certain issues would arise in the assignments I coded for some
        classes. I hoped that my work at Adknown developing and debugging my own games would help me develop ways to
        efficiently catch and remedy my mistakes.
        <br><br>
        As an avid gamer since childhood, a natural extension to my hobby was deciding to could create my own games and
        entertain others with my own creations. Learning Unity, one of the most popular game engines on the market right
        now, was a natural step into game development. I was given the opportunity to finally learn and use Unity when
        working at Adknown, and I learned a lot about the engine and by extension, game development as a whole.
      </div>

      <div>
        <figure class="figure">
          <img src="images/adknown-survival-square-gameplay.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block center"
            alt="Survival Square mobile game">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-md-center">My last game, Survival Square, could've ended up even better had I not
            spent
            so much time on animation.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div>
        I also wanted to utilize version control systems in a professional environment. I’ve only ever used systems like
        Github as a repository to store projects rather than continuously update them, so seeing a system in action
        could
        show me how to better organize my own projects in the future. At Adknown, we used Bitbucket to keep archives of
        our games’ files. It was a good system that I don’t have any qualms with.
        <br><br>
        Finally, I wanted a better taste of working with mobile systems. I made some rudimentary Android projects in the
        past, but never explored making full fledged apps for it or iOS. While I did learn about the importance of
        making
        a product that can conform to all sorts of resolutions, I didn’t directly code in Android Studio or Swift. I
        just
        programmed my games in C# and Unity would handle conversion and compilation for iOS or Android systems itself. A
        bit disappointing, but it did save a lot of work doing the conversion manually.
        <br><br>
        <li>
          <i>Proficiency in Unity</i>: I definitely became more proficient in Unity (when your knowledge before landing
          the
          job was
          nothing, the only real place to go is up), but still have a lot of room to grow. I feel like I’m in that stage
          where I know how to do basic stuff like working in one game scene and using Unity specific tools (prefabs,
          aniamtion override controllers, etc.) but am still in the dark about more advanced stuff (multiple scenes) or
          little tricks that could improve my efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Debugging</i>: This is difficult to gauge because I didn’t really follow any of my outlined steps in my
          goal
          (writing
          down a process to follow when debugging), but I still feel like I’ve become more “aware” of what I type. Back
          in
          school, I felt like I’d go on autopilot regularly and forget about blocks of code I just wrote. By developing
          and
          tending to a sizable project I made in a professional work environment, I think I became better at identifying
          connections between the cause and effect of issues that arose.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Social Skills</i>: I feel like this is the goal I had the most accomplished. I can’t really measure this
          one
          with a
          scale or anything, but I ended the co-op term on at least acquaintance terms with every co-worker on Adknown’s
          game development team, which I’m proud of. I believe I improved my active listening skills throughout the
          semester
          by taking feedback from teammates regarding game design.
        </li>
        <br>
        In conclusion, I made noticeable progress on all my goals. I wouldn’t technically call any of them complete,
        which
        was my plan from the start. They’re goals that I want to develop over time; seeing some sort of positive net
        gain
        on them during my time at Adknown is enough to make me satisfied that I spent my time there wisely.

        At Adknown Games, we developed games for iOS and Android over 2 week cycles. This short development time means
        we
        can’t explore overly ambitious ideas (sorry, no JRPGs). We also have to steer clear of any ideas too closely
        resembling previous Adknown games, but other than that anything’s fair game as long as the Team Lead says it’s
        okay.
        <br><br>
        A typical cycle at Adknown Games usually followed this strict format:
      </div>

      <div>
        <li>
          <i>Concept Development</i>: Spend some time to brainstorm a game idea. If the idea is deemed feasible and good
          by
          the
          Team Lead, begin paper prototyping and planning how you’re going to develop the thing.
          Initial Development: Time to make your game! Right now, the focus is the main gameplay loop and UI. Finishing
          the
          UI now saves a lot of headache later, and having your basic gameplay completed is basically mandatory in order
          to
          complete the next step.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Mid-cycle Quality Assurance (QA)</i>: Your game is evaluated by the Team Lead and fellow developers. Most
          of
          the big
          glaring issues in your game’s design will likely be discovered here. Sometimes you’ll have to rework your game
          entirely once enough problems are found, but luckily I’ve never had to do that. I did have to make a
          substantial
          changes to my games usually, but it was always for the better.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Final Developmen</i>t: Get the music and sound in your game. Set up the shop so the user can buy cool
          cosmetics
          using
          in-game currency. Create a list of missions for players to tackle. Basically, drop a large bucket of polish
          onto
          your game so that it can exceed standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Publishing and End-of-cycle QA</i>: Get your game ready to launch on the Play Store and/or App Store by
          preparing
          promotional material and writing good, keyword-heavy descriptions. Also, the Team Lead and other developers
          will
          give your game one final look to make sure it’s up to snuff before you’re given the green light to send your
          game
          into open beta.
        </li>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
        With a cycle as tight as this, good time management and organization are key. During development of my final
        game,
        Survival Square, I spent far too much time trying to get animation override controllers working so that my
        enemies
        could have animated sprites. As a result, I had to hustle during the final stages of development and didn’t have
        as much polish put in as I would’ve liked. Had I better managed my time and made decisions faster, I like
        could've
        made the final product even better.
      </div>

      <div>
        <figure class="figure">
          <img src="images/adknown-tile-shield-gameplay.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block center"
            alt="Tile Shield mobile game">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-md-center">My second game, Tile Shield, had the most stressful development out of any
            of
            my games. The final product is definitely a game all right, and also remains a project I probably should’ve
            saved for when I had more experience up my belt.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div>
        Creativity was also a useful skill to have on hand during development. Obviously, a more creative mind can
        produce
        more creative game ideas, but creativity can also bleed into other aspects of development. Making shop items
        that
        are meaningful and get a chuckle out of others, smart sound design that clearly indicates what the developer
        wants
        the player to know about something, all of these are affected by the developer’s creativity.
        <br><br>
        There’s many other skills that are useful for a job such as this. One of my fellow co-op hires mentions
        resilience, which I can’t deny, but many basic programming skills such as debugging, problem solving and
        critical
        thinking are also necessary. Working as a game developer at Adknown was definitely not easy, but had many
        satisfying and rewarding moments that made the grind worth it.
        <br><br>
        To conclude this section, I’ll mention that the actual things taught in class aren’t too useful for this job. No
        C
        or memory management in sight here. However, classes do teach the importance of deadlines, of how to write good
        code, and how to solve problems when your head is plastered against a brick wall, all of which were invaluable
        skills to have working as a game developer at Adknown. So in conclusion, school was useful and developing games
        in
        2 week cycles is simultaneously stressful and satisfying.

        In conclusion, my time spent at Adknown was a great learning experience. I was able to explore the joys and
        frustrations of game development and learned a lot about game design and good programming practice. I improved
        my
        coding and social skills after setting and achieving substantial progress on my goals. Finally, I got to do it
        all
        with a reliable team who weren’t afraid to give constructive criticism and crack some jokes too.
        <br><br>
        Though my time working at Adknown was fun, it also helped me realize that game development is not for me. I’ll
        likely keep game development as a side hobby rather than the main focus of my career. Still, I have developed a
        humble appreciation for those who dedicate their lives to the difficult path of game development. I’m thankful
        for
        my time spent at Adknown and wish only the best for everyone there.
