        <p class="text-md-left">
          This is a report of my time working at the Co-operators as a Co-op Developer, from January to August 2021. Due
          to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entirety of this 8-month co-op term was a Work From Home affair. Still, I
          learned a lot about software development process and skills within a large company, and I hope to present my
          learnings and experiences in the following report.

          The Co-operators Group Limited is a Canadian insurance and financial services co-operative company. They have
          over $50 billion in assets under management and provide financial solutions of all sorts. The company
          currently employs over 6000 employees, serves over 200 credit unions, has over 2000 licensed insurance
          representatives throughout Canada. They are headquartered in the city of Guelph.

          During my 8 months at the company, I worked on the Digital Technology Operations (DTO) team. Our job was to
          provide support to the company website, whether it be picking up tickets to solve back-end or front-end
          website problems of any sort or tackling high-priority incidents on the website that necessitate immediate
          fixes. With an average of less than a dozen members on our team throughout my time there, every member's work
          counted when it came to meeting sprint goals.

        <p class="text-md-left">
        <p>
          Having worked at The Co-operators for 8 months, I had two semesters of goals set for myself:
        </p>>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <i>Stay focused and productive in a work-from-home environment</i>: I made this goal as I felt my
            productivity dropped significantly during my study semester of Fall 2020. Thus, I resolved to remove
            distractions (game systems, phone, etc.) from my work desk and prepared to move to a different part of the
            house to work if need be. I thought that if I could work for 30+ minutes interrupted, then U would have
            achieved this goal. Ultimately, I did somewhat accomplish this goal, but in bursts. When I had direction in
            how to tackle the work, I would work diligently. However, there were still periods of my proeductivity
            dropping and my focus being shifted to other things, so my ultimate progress on this front is just half a
            thumbs up instead of a big thumbs up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Continue development of skills needed for a team environment</i>: At Camis, I had the same
            goal of being able to collaborate and effectively aid other people on my team with work, by practicing
            proactive and initiative. My daily tasks (stand-up meetings, solving tickets efficiently, working with
            fellow devs to resolve issues) should've aided in improving my collaboration, communication, and problem
            solving skills, all of which are vital to a team environment. However, since I was working from home, I felt
            like it was difficult to work towards this goal, as the loss of face-to-face communication greatly
            diminished my ability to not just be more proactive, but social.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Become proficient in Angular, React, and other front-end frameworks</i>: This was also a goal I set for
            myself in the second semester. With every new job comes new responsibilities and often, new technologies
            that need to be understood. In the case of this position, I wanted to learn new front-end frameworks. In the
            first semester, I thought I could tackle tickets regarding these frameworks and learn on the fly, but that
            ended up not being very feasible. In the second semester, I decided to take the learning off-work hours and
            try something like Pluralsight to learn the new material.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Semester 2 Goals</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <i>Improve documentation/information retainment skills</i>: In order to improve my ability to remember
            things, I wanted to try to better my documentation skills. Basically, I wanted to be able to consult my own
            writings instead of having to always consult other people. I did this by recording more of what comes my
            way,
            from specific repository setup instructions to knowledge transfer sessions, on either Confluence or paper.
            When it came to documenting my work on specific tickets I think I did a good job of compiling spreadsheets,
            point form notes, etc. to aid my memory and progress. I didn't make many notable notes on knowledge
            transfers or instructions though, but I still think this goal was a success since my process of solving
            problems now utilizes documentation more fluidly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Increase initiative</i>: Pretty straightforward. Don't be afraid to ask question and pick up tickets you
            aren't familiar with. I definitely slept on this goal for the start of the semester but I think I
            improved by the second half as I picked up a lot more tasks I wasn't familiar with and tried to seek out
            help if need be. I wasn't perfect in this pursuit, but still successful enough by my standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Fix problem solving skills</i>: Maybe it's because of working online for nearly a year now (both studying
            and working), but I felt like my problem solving skills had diminished. Like the previous goal of
            initiative, my plan for improvement isn't well-defined, but rather, I tried try to think more critically
            when I attempt to tackle problems rather than immediately throw myself into the fray. I ultimately chalked
            up this goal as a net neutral, as I did somewhat repair my ability to think through a problem... at times.
          </li>
        </ol>
