            Founded in the days of MS-DOS, Camis is a Guelph-based company that provides software solutions for park
            management and campground reservations. The company’s clients include the government agency owned Parks
            Canada
            as well as Ontario Provincial Parks, Washington State Parks and more. Camis also operates call centers in
            Maryland, Michigan, Wisconsin and of course Guelph.
            <br><br>
            Camis’s proprietary software handles park permits (handed out at the park to provide confirmation of your
            arrival), park reservations and point of sale transactions for various goods (firewood, boating permits,
            etc).
            The program has had 3 major iterations so far:
            <br><br>
            <li>
              <i>Original command line version</i>: An obsolete version that resembles a command line. From what I could
              tell, it didn't have an official name.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Everest</i>: a legacy software built upon Microsoft Silverlight, a framework for writing and running
              internet
              applications. With Silverlight being discontinued in late 2021, the company has transitioned many of its
              clients
              away from this version of the software.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Camis 5</i>: the current solution built from the ground up in-house and used by most of Camis’s clients
              today.
              I worked for Camis from September to December 2019 as a Software Developer co-op and was a member of the
              small
              but humble Everest team. As a result of maintaining aging software, I didn’t have the chance to design and
              program new features. However, I still took on a variety of roles such as updating configuration,
              debugging
              errors and tinkering with databases. Being on this team presented me with the opportunity to learn more
              about an
              area of Computer Science I’m not too familiar with as well as giving me the chance to contribute to a side
              project that further bolstered my learning.

              <li>Become proficient with SQL, databases, and web service development.</li>
              <li>Improve initiative.</li>
              <li>Develop skills needed for a team development environment.</li>

              I developed my goals after about a week and a half at the job. As a result, they were closely tied with
              (what I believe) my tasks to be and would provide me with growth in both my technical skills (SQL and web
              services) and soft skills (initiative, collaboration). The latter two goals also mixed in some other
              skills
              I’m always looking to improve, like problem solving (e.g. taking the initiative to tackle problems on my
              own
              while still being able to ask for help when needed).
              <br><br>
              The big thing I wanted to learn about was SQL. With databases being so prominent in almost all fields of
              computer science, knowing how to use the most common language for managing data in a relational database
              is
              almost mandatory. I absolutely wanted to learn the basics at least, and hoped to gain more intermediate
              knowledge afterwards.
              Though not listed as any one of my goals, I also wanted to improve my ability to communicate effectively
              because I felt that I was too quiet and reserved at my last co-op job until about the last month.
              <br><br>
              <li>
                <i>SQL, databases, web server dev</i>: Compared to how much I knew about SQL and databases at the start
                of
                the semester (zero), I think I’ve made substantial progress with this goal. I learned about SQL syntax,
                how to make queries, and what relational databases are. I also learned about intermediate concepts such
                as
                the SQL order of operations and temp tables. I haven’t become as highly proficent as I thought I could
                be,
                but I’ve definitely made a lot of progress with this goal. Upcoming courses this winter semester will
                only
                benefit my learning in this area.
              </li>
              <li>
                <i>Initiative</i>: I think I’ve made good progress with this goal. Due to the nature of my team’s work
                and
                the team’s small size in comparison to the amount of work we had to do, I was allowed to deal with
                client
                request tickets from the same pool as the other fully qualified developers on my team. Being able to fix
                issues that full-time devs also regularly deal with has allowed me to develop my problem solving and
                thinking skills while also improving my initiative to tackle issues on my own and ask others for help
                when
                I needed it (which trust me, I needed a lot). I think in the future, a greater emphasis should be put on
                my initiative in regards to communication. I’ll go more in-depth about that in the next numbered bullet
                point.
              </li>
              <li>
                <i>Team-based skills</i>: The nature of my work meant that I didn’t actually get to do as much
                team-based
                work as I expected. However, I do believe that I could’ve done better with this goal. I still believe I
                was more outgoing than at my last position, but the detail in which I explained things verbally and my
                ability to speak up at team meetings left much to be desired. I also think that I should try to be more
                active when listening and watching someone teach me something as I’m often passive during these moments.
              </li>
              <br><br>
              In conclusion, I think I did pretty well with making progress on most of my goals. Like my goals from the
              summer co-op term, they’re not meant to be 100% completed but rather used to build upon skills needed for
              me
              to excel as both a software developer and a person.

                Camis operates within the typical two week agile development cycles, closely following scrum principles,
                which focuses on breaking down a big
                issues into individual, feasible goals that can be met within the cycle’s time frame. Every two weeks,
                new
                tickets would appear on the Everest squad’s development pile. These issues would range from bug fix
                requests to small configuration updates (e.g. updating text on reservation confirmation emails) to the
                very rare feature request (I wasn’t allowed to do these for obvious reasons).
                <br><br>
                The bulk of my work typically involved the following:
                <br><br>
                <li>
                  <i>Configuration updates</i>: Much of the work I had to do was for the upcoming summer season, the
                  busiest time
                  of the year for most parks and campgrounds. As a result, most of the work available each cycle were
                  simple
                  fixes to things such as reservable dates, restrictive messages, and the like. These were the first
                  type
                  of
                  issues I tackled as they were simple and good for helping me learn how Everest worked from the inside
                  out.
                  I still worked on these occasionally later on, but by the last month I had moved on to greener (and
                  less
                  tedious) pastures. It involved looking at a lot of front-end related files so I became acquainted with
                  HTML5, CSS, XSLT and XML.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Bug fixing</i>: Most of the bug fixes I did were related to visual inconsistencies with the
                  software
                  such as
                  incorrect information displayed or information being missing. There would be the occasional chance for
                  me
                  to head into Everest’s business logic to locate the issue there, but that was usually out of the scope
                  of
                  what I was capable of and allowed to do. Much of this work involved C# (for the code itself) and T-SQL
                  (for checking how some issues manifested on the database or just checking if data was stored
                  correctly).
                  Microsoft Visual Studio and SQL Server Management Studio were used, respectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>""Pair"" programming</i>: I would occasionally be called over to observe my supervisor tackle a
                  more
                  complex problem (such as critical compliance changes or tracking a bug that had plagued the system for
                  months). I wouldn’t be the one coding here but instead watching how my supervisor thought and tackled
                  the
                  problem. I didn’t really provide a lot of feedback (which I regret, as mentioned in the Goals at Camis
                  section) but I did get to see how a seasoned developer used what he had to deal with a problem that
                  was
                  hard to wrap one’s head around initially.
                </li>
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, I wasn’t given the chance to do any new feature development. With what I had, I
                definitely
                preferred the bug fix work over the configuration stuff since it was more stimulating, less tedious, and
                let me think. The C focused knowledge I acquired from my classes wasn’t too handy at this job as
                expected,
                but knowledge from my last job at Adknown (C#, Visual Studio, debugging techniques) proved to be highly
                useful at Camis.

                  The most interesting thing I did at Camis wasn’t even related to the work from the company’s clients;
                  it
                  was a side project entrusted to me by my supervisor Taylor. The project was deceptively simple (though
                  not intentionally):
                  <br><br>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Take the existing Build Monitor extension for Visual Studio and change it to gather specific metrics
                    such as CPU and RAM in addition to the extension’s pre-existing feature of timing how long it takes
                    a
                    Visual Studio solution to build.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Create a simple web service that will receive the metrics from the modified extension and store it
                    in
                    a
                    table in a relational database.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Allow the database to be queried for the metric data.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                Additional requirements, such as being able to use Splunk to query the database for specific
                correlations and additional data, were to be left for the next guy to take on the project. I was given
                in my second week and wrapped up my section in my final few days at Camis.
                <br><br>
                I liked doing this project for several reasons. Firstly, it tied directly into my goal of knowing more
                about SQL and web services. This goal was actually created based on the required knowledge needed to
                complete this project. Doing the project allowed me to both gain knowledge of SQL, databases, web
                services, and more and put it to practical use. The project did end up being overwhelming at times, but
                the extensive help provided by Taylor allowed me to arrive at a satisfying result. Secondly, it was good
                change of pace from both my usual work at Camis and what I’ve been learning at school. I hadn’t tackled
                the concepts of web-based endpoints, GET/POST. relational databases, and more before. Doing this project
                allowed me to gain knowledge on many software engineering topics that are invaluable for a developer to
                have in this day and age.
                <br><br>
                To conclude this section, I enjoyed most of the work I did at Camis, even if it was difficult or a tad
                boring at times. Many of the things I did taught me either valuable soft skills like problem solving or
                technical skills like what is and how to write a query.

                    In conclusion, my time spent at Camis was a great learning experience. I was able to learn a lot
                    more
                    about many important topics in computing, such as databases, web services and more. I improved my
                    problem solving and debugging skills and achieved substantial progress on my goals. Finally, I got
                    to
                    do it all with a reliable team who always had my back.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m still not entirely sure what strand of computer science/software engineering I’m going to pursue
                    as my lifelong career. However, what I did at Camis did make me consider web-based development as an
                    option. I may explore related work in my future positions.

                      A special thanks to the following people for making my time at Camis great:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <b>Taylor Poulin</b>, my supervisor, for being a helpful and reliable mentor figure. Taylor was
                        always
                        ready to lend his aid (if he wasn’t caught up in a meeting or unlucky occurrence) and was
                        instrumental in teaching me SQL, database design, how web services work, and much more. The fact
                        that he took time out of his busy schedule to sit down with me and help me learn to be a better
                        developer is something I’ll always appreciate and be grateful for.
                        Stefan Barrette, for helping me with specific details in configuration changes on countless
                        occasions and being an upbeat presence. His patience and reliability was indispensable for
                        everyone
                        on the Everest squad.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Julian Verity</b>, for being a kind helping hand to everyone and going above and beyond his
                        developer
                        duties, even organizing sessions for the devs to sit down and learn new things via Pluralsight.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Dhaval Pathak</b>, for guiding me through Everest and more during my first week at Camis as
                        Taylor was
                        out on vacation. Without him, I would’ve fumbled around in Everest’s business logic for much
                        longer
                        than I did.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Josh Nasso</b>, for his solid testing of my fixes and always being friendly and accommodating
                        with me.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Colby Warkentin</b>, whose keen eye and deep experience working with Everest allowed him to
                        catch my
                        mistakes in code review and recommend the best course of action to resolve them.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Hassan Hassan</b>, for providing a comprehensive orientation that got me and the other co-op
                        students up to
                        speed.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Victoria MacKenzie</b>, for being extremely helpful and reliable for any of my HR related
                        issues and
                        also being excellent during orientation.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Everyone else at Camis</b>, take care and thanks for helping make my time at
                        Camis great, even if indirectly and if most of us never met face to face!
